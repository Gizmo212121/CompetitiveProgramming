I already know what a sorting algorithm is, but what is a stable sort?

A stable sort is a sorting algorithm where equivalent elements are guaranteed to stay in the same order. For example, say we have a program that is supposed to sort a list of names based on the first two characters. The caveat is that when two strings are the "same" (their first two characters are the same), you don't swap them in the sort. With a regular sort like std::sort, this rule will be violated. With std::stable_sort, the order is preserved.

In the stable sort, the following two names never move with respect to each other

...
...
...
levi
lexy
...
...
...
